        <h2> DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            After releasing their 2012 full-length debut Night Visions (featuring the Grammy Award-winning single “Radioactive”),
            Imagine Dragons spent nearly two years bringing their passionately inventive brand of alt-rock to arenas around
            the world. To deal with the chaos of a touring schedule that included 130 headline dates and 50 festivals across
            the globe, the Las Vegas-based quartet threw themselves into creating material for their next album. “So many 
            things were changing for us so quickly, the only way to feel some kind of stability was to keep writing,” says
            frontman Dan Reynolds, who founded Imagine Dragons with guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer
            Daniel Platzman. “Going up to my hotel room to work on new songs became something I looked forward to every 
            night on tour,” Reynolds adds. “There were definitely a few times when the person next door’s banging on the 
            wall because it’s 4 a.m. and they’re trying to sleep and I’m in there belting out some song I just wrote.”

             Live performance has always been essential to Imagine Dragons, who formed in 2009 and quickly earned a grassroots
            following by touring extensively and independently releasing a series of EPs. After signing to 
            KIDinaKORNER/Interscope Records, the band made their major-label debut with the release of Continued Silence
            (a 2012 EP featuring the breakthrough single “It’s Time”). Once Night Visions arrived later that same year, 
            Imagine Dragons soon found themselves on a skyward trajectory that saw the album climbing to #2 on the Billboard
            200 chart, as well as the group taking home the Best Rock Performance for “Radioactive” at the 2014 Grammy Awards.
